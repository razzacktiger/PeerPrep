# PeerPrep
Peer Interview Prep Platform

# üìÑ CMPE 277 Project Proposal

**Project Title:** **PeerPrep ‚Äì Collaborative Interview & Study Practice App**
**Team Members:** Haroon Razzack 
**Course:** CMPE 277 ‚Äì Mobile Device Development

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Preparing for technical interviews and exams can be lonely and inconsistent. Students often lack accountability, structured feedback, or peers to practice with. As a result, they either under-prepare or lose confidence. There is currently no lightweight, mobile-first tool that allows students to easily **pair up, practice, and get immediate feedback** on their performance.

---

## 2. Project Scope

PeerPrep is a **cross-platform mobile app** (Android + iOS) designed to connect learners for **real-time practice sessions**, generate **practice questions**, and provide **instant structured feedback**.

The scope of this project is to:

* Build a **fully functional MVP** that allows authenticated users to select a topic, join a practice queue, get paired with a peer, conduct a timed session, and leave feedback.
* Integrate a **low-cost AI solution** to generate new practice questions, summarize sessions, and provide rubric-style feedback.
* Track user streaks and progress over time, encouraging consistent practice habits.
* Deliver a visually polished and responsive app, with push notifications, real-time pairing, and cloud-synced data.

---

## 3. Target Audience

* **Primary:** University students preparing for coding interviews, quizzes, or technical exams.
* **Secondary:** Early-career developers and job seekers who want structured peer practice.

**Personas:**

* *‚ÄúRiya, 23‚Äù* ‚Äì A senior CS student who wants to practice behavioral and system design questions before internship interviews.
* *‚ÄúSam, 25‚Äù* ‚Äì A bootcamp grad seeking mock interviews for confidence and accountability.

## 4. Key Features (Prioritized)

### **MVP (Must Have ‚Äì Weeks 1‚Äì4)**

* üîê **Authentication & Profiles** (Supabase Auth)
* üìö **Topic Selection & Instant Pairing** (Edge Function matchmaking)
* ‚è± **Session Room:** Timer + question display + optional recording toggle (audio/video)
* üí¨ **Peer Feedback:** Quick rubric rating and notes
* ü§ñ **AI Cross-Check:** AI reviews session transcript (if recording enabled) and provides a secondary rating + short summary to mitigate trolling or unfair peer ratings.
* üîî **Push Notifications:** Session ready, reminders
* üìä **Dashboard:** Track completed sessions, streaks, and average feedback scores

### **Session Flow Example**

1. **Topic Selection:** User picks a topic (e.g., Data Structures) and joins queue.
2. **Instant Pairing:** Edge Function matches two users waiting for the same topic.
3. **Session Room:** Displays countdown timer, first question, and optional note-taking area. Users alternate answering questions or discussing solutions, optionally enabling voice/video call.
4. **Recording & AI Feedback (Optional):** If users consent, audio is recorded and transcribed for AI to generate a fairness score, predicted rubric, and brief explanation.
5. **Peer Feedback:** At session end, both participants rate each other with a rubric (clarity, correctness, confidence) and can leave notes.
6. **Dashboard Update:** Streaks, AI feedback, and scores update for both users.

### **Phase 2 (Nice to Have ‚Äì Weeks 5‚Äì6)**

* ü§ñ **AI Question Generation:** Use Groq/Gemini API to generate or vary questions on-demand
* üìù **AI Rubric Feedback & Session Summary:** Actionable suggestions in <1s
* üèÜ **Leaderboard / Consistency Streaks:** Gamify practice

### **Stretch Goals (Weeks 7‚Äì8 if ahead of schedule)**

* üìÖ **Scheduling:** Book a session in advance
* üé• **Video/Voice Integration:** Full-featured LiveKit or Google Meet integration with mute/unmute controls
* üì§ **Session Export:** Email or save notes, ratings, and AI summary for later review

## 6. System Architecture (High-Level)

```text
+----------------+           +---------------------+
|  React Native  | <-------> | Supabase REST / RT  |
|  (Expo Client) |           | + Edge Functions    |
+-------+--------+           +-----+---------------+
        |                          |
        |        AI Calls          |
        +------------------------->+ Groq/Gemini API (Q Generation, Scoring)
                                   + Whisper (Transcription)
```

* Frontend communicates with Supabase for auth, matchmaking, and data persistence.
* Supabase Edge Functions handle pairing logic and enforce security rules.
* AI API is called only when needed (question generation, feedback, transcript scoring), with results cached in the DB.

## 6.1 Recording & Transcription Architecture (Optional)

**Goal:** Provide fair, secondary AI scoring while keeping costs and privacy under control.

**Flow:**

1. **Consent & Toggle:** Users explicitly opt-in to recording inside the Session Room.
2. **Local Capture (Audio-Only for MVP):** Record WebM/Opus, hard-cap ‚â§15 minutes and show remaining time.
3. **Upload to Storage:** Client uploads directly to Supabase Storage (private bucket) using a signed URL.
4. **Transcription Job:** Edge Function/worker pulls file via signed URL ‚Üí runs Whisper ‚Üí saves transcript to Postgres.
5. **AI Fairness Check:** Pass transcript and rubric to Groq/Gemini ‚Üí get predicted rubric scores, rationale, confidence.
6. **Persist Minimal Data:** Store only transcript + AI scores, auto-delete raw audio after 7‚Äì14 days.
7. **Access Control:** Private bucket with signed URLs, RLS on transcript rows.

**Cost & Privacy Notes:**

* Audio-only keeps files small (\~1‚Äì2 MB/min) and cost low.
* Add per-user quotas and daily AI credit caps.
* Display clear consent text and allow user-initiated deletion.

**If Video Later:** Use LiveKit for real-time A/V and S3/R2 for cloud recording output, storing only transcripts + scores in Supabase.
